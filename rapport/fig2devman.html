     fig2dev - translates Fig code to various graphics languages


</PRE>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>
     fig2dev -L <I>language</I> [ -m <I>mag</I> ] [ -f <I>font</I> ] [ -s  <I>fsize</I>  ]  [
     <I>other</I> <I>options</I> ] [ <I>fig</I>-<I>file</I> [ <I>out</I>-<I>file</I> ] ]


</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
     <I>Fig2dev</I> translates fig code in the named <I>fig</I>-<I>file</I>  into  the
     specified  graphics  <I>language</I> and puts them in <I>out</I>-<I>file</I>. The
     default <I>fig</I>-<I>file</I> and <I>out</I>-<I>file</I> are standard input  and  stan-
     dard output, respectively

     Fig (Facility for Interactive Generation of  figures)  is  a
     screen-oriented tool which allows the user to draw and mani-
     pulate objects interactively.  Various versions of  Fig  run
     under the Suntools/Sunview window environment and under ver-
     sion 11 of the X Windows System.  Fig2dev is compatible with
     Fig versions 1.3, 1.4, 2.0, 2.1, 3.0, 3.1 and 3.2.

<H2>OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
     -L   Set the output graphics language.  Valid languages  are
          acad  (AutoCad  slide  format), box, epic, eepic, eepi-
          cemu, gif, ibmgl, jpeg, latex, mf (METAFONT), pcx, pic,
          pictex,  png, ppm, ps, pstex, pstex_t, textyl, tiff, tk
          (tcl/tk), tpic, xbm and xpm.

          Note that <I>dvips</I> and <I>xdvi</I> must be compiled with the tpic
          support (-DTPIC) for epic, eepic and tpic to work.

     -h   Print help message with  all  options  for  all  output
          languages.

     -m   Set the magnification at which the figure  is  rendered
          to <I>mag</I>. The default is 1.0.

     -f   Set the default font used for text objects to <I>font</I>. The
          default  is Roman; the format of this option depends on
          the graphics <I>language</I> in use.  In TeX-based  languages,
          the  font  is the base of the name given in lfonts.tex,
          for instance "cmr" for Roman, or "tt" for teletype.  In
          PostScript, it is any font name known to the printer or
          interpreter.

     -s   Set the default font size (in points) for text  objects
          to  <I>fsize</I>. The default is 11*mag, and thus is scaled by
          the -m option.  If there is  no  scaling,  the  default
          font is eleven point Roman."

     -V   Print the program version number only.

     <I>other</I> <I>options</I>
          The other options are specific to the choice of  graph-
          ics <I>language</I>, as described below.

<H2>EPIC OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
     EPIC is an enhancement to LaTeX picture drawing environment.
     It  was  developed  by Sunil Podar of Department of Computer
     Science in S.U.N.Y at Stony Brook.

     EEPIC is an extension to  EPIC  and  LaTeX  picture  drawing
     environment  which  uses tpic specials as a graphics mechan-
     ism.  It was written by Conrad Kwok of Division of  Computer
     Science at University of California, Davis.

     EEPIC-EMU is an EEPIC emulation package which does  not  use
     tpic specials.

     -A   Scale arrowheads by <I>factor</I>. The  width  and  height  of
          arrowheads  is <I>divided</I> by this factor.  This is because
          <I>EPIC</I> arrowheads are normally about double the  size  of
          <I>TeX</I> arrowheads.

     -l   Use "\thicklines" when width of the line is wider  than
          <I>lwidth</I>. The default is 2.

     -v   Include comments in the output file.

     -P   Generate a complete LaTeX file.  In  other  words,  the
          output  file  can  be  formatted  without requiring any
          changes. The additional text inserted in the  beginning
          and  at the end of the file is controlled by the confi-
          guration parameter "Preamble" and "Postamble".

     -S   Set the scale to which the figure  is  rendered.   This
          option automatically sets the <I>magnification</I> and size to
          <I>scale</I> / 12 and <I>scale</I> respectively.

     -W   Enable variable line width.  By default, only two  line
          widths are available: The normal line width (hinlines),
          and thick lines (hicklines), if a line  width  of  more
          than one is selected in xfig.

     -w   Disable variable line width. Only "\thicklines"  and/or
          "\thinlines"  commands  will be generated in the output
          file.

     When variable line width  option  is  enabled,  "\thinlines"
     command  is  still used when line width is less than <I>LineTh-</I>
     <I>ick</I>. One potential problem is that the width of "\thinlines"
     is  0.4pt  but  the  resolution of Fig is 1/80 inch (approx.
     1pt). If <I>LineThick</I> is set to 2, normal lines will  be  drawn
     in  0.4pt wide lines but the next line width is already 2pt.
     One possible solution is to set <I>LineThick</I> to 1 and  set  the
     width  of  the  those  lines you want to be drawn in "\thin-
     lines"  to 0.

     Due  to  this  problem,  Variable  line  width  <I>VarWidth</I>  is
     defaulted to be false.

<H2>IBM-GL OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
     IBM-GL (International Business Machines  Graphics  Language)
     is   compatible   with   HP-GL   (Hewlett-Packard   Graphics
     Language).

     -a   Select ISO A4 (ANSI A) paper size  if  the  default  is
          ANSI A (ISO A4) paper size.

     -c   Generate instructions for an  IBM  6180  Color  Plotter
          with  (without)  an  IBM Graphics Enhancement Cartridge
          (IBM-GEC).

     -d   Restrict plotting to a rectangular area of the  plotter
          paper  which  has a lower left hand corner at (<I>xll</I>,<I>yll</I>)
          and a upper right hand corner at  (<I>xur</I>,<I>yur</I>).  All  four
          numbers are in inches and follow -d in a comma-sparated
          list - <I>xll</I>,<I>yll</I>,<I>xur</I>,<I>yur</I> - with no spaces between them.

     -f   Load text character specifications from  the  table  in
          the  <I>fonts</I>  file.  The table must have 36 entries - one
          for each font plus a default.  Each entry consists of 5
          numbers which specify the 1.) standard character set (0
          - 4, 6 - 9, 30 - 39), 2.) alternate character set (0  -
          4,  6  -  9,  30  -  39),  3.)  character  slant  angle
          (degrees), 4.) character width  scale  factor  and  5.)
          character height scale factor.

     -l   Load area fill line patterns from the table in the <I>pat-</I>
          <I>terns</I>  file.   The table must have 21 entries - one for
          each of the area fill patterns.  Each entry consists of
          5  numbers  which  specify the 1.) pattern number (-1 -
          6), 2.) pattern length (inches), 3.) fill type (1 - 5),
          4.) fill spacing (inches) and 5.) fill angle (degrees).

     -m   The magnification may appear as the first element in  a
          comma separated list - <I>mag</I>,<I>x0</I>,<I>y0</I> - where the second and
          third parameters specify an offset in inches.

     -p   Load plotter pen specifications from the table  in  the
          <I>pens</I>  file.   The  table  must have 9 entries - one for
          each color plus a default.  Each entry  consists  of  2
          numbers  which  specify  the 1.) pen number (1 - 8) and
          2.) pen thickness (millimeters).

     -P   Rotate the figure to  portrait  mode.  The  default  is
          landscape mode.

     -S   Set the pen speed to <I>speed</I> (centimeters/second).

     -v   Plot the figure upside-down in portrait mode  or  back-
          wards  in  landscape mode.  This allows you to write on
          the top surface of overhead transparencies without dis-
          turbing the plotter ink on the bottom surface.

     Fig2dev may be installed  with  either  ANSI  A  or  ISO  A4
     default  paper  size.   The  -a option selects the alternate
     paper size.  Fig2dev does  not  fill  closed  splines.   The
     IBM-GEC  is required to fill other polygons.  Fig2dev may be
     installed for plotters with or without the IBM-GEC.  The  -c
     option selects the alternate instruction set.


</PRE>
<H2>LATEX OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
     -l   Sets the threshold between LaTeX thin and  thick  lines
          to  <I>lwidth</I>  pixels.   LaTeX supports only two different
          line width: \thinlines and \thicklines.  Lines of width
          greater  than  <I>lwidth</I>  pixels are drawn as \thicklines.
          Also affects the size of dots  in  dotted  line  style.
          The default is 1.

     -d   Set a separate magnification for  the  length  of  line
          dashes to <I>dmag</I>.

     -v   Verbose mode.

     LaTeX cannot accurately represent all the  graphics  objects
     which  can  be  described by Fig.  For example, the possible
     slopes which lines may have are limited.  Some objects, such
     as spline curves, cannot be drawn at all.  Fig2latex chooses
     the closest possible line slope, and prints  error  messages
     when objects cannot be drawn accurately


</PRE>
<H2>PIC OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
     -p   Enables the use of certain  PIC  extensions  which  are
          known  to  work  with  the groff package; compatibility
          with DWB PIC is unknown.   The  extensions  enabled  by
          each option are:

           arc     Allow ARC_BOX i.e. use rounded corners
           line    Use the 'line_thickness' value
           fill    Allow ellipses to be filled
           all     Use all of the above
           psfont  Don't convert Postscript fonts generic type
                   (useful for files going to be Ditroff'ed for
                   and printed on PS printer). DWB-compatible.
           allps   Use all of the above (i.e. "all" + "psfont")


</PRE>
<H2>PICTEX OUTPUT</H2><PRE>
     In order to include PiCTeX pictures into a document,  it  is
     necessary to load the PiCTeX macros.

     PiCTeX uses TeX  integer  register  arithmetic  to  generate
     curves,  and  so  it  is  very slow.  PiCTeX draws curves by
     \put-ing the <I>psymbol</I> repeatedly, and  so  requires  a  large
     amount  of  TeX's  internal  memory, and generates large DVI
     files.  The size of TeX's memory limits the number  of  plot
     symbols in a picture.  As a result, it is best to use PiCTeX
     to generate small pictures.


</PRE>
<H2>POSTSCRIPT OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
     With PostScript, Fig can be used to  create  large  posters.
     The  figure will be created by printing multiple pages which
     can be glued together.  Simply specify the -M option to pro-
     duce a multi-page output.  Due to memory limitations of most
     laser printers, the figure should not  be  too  complicated.
     Great for text with very big letters.

     Text can now include various ISO-character codes above 0x7f,
     which  is  useful  for  language  specific  characters to be
     printed directly.  Not all ISO-characters are implemented.

     Color support: Colored objects created by Fig can be printed
     on a color postscript printer. There are 32 standard colors:
     black, yellow, white, gold, five shades of blue, four shades
     of  green,  four  shades  of  cyan, four shades of red, five
     shades of magenta, four shades of brown, and four shades  of
     pink.   In  addition there may be user-defined colors in the
     file.  See the xfig FORMAT3.2 file  for  the  definition  of
     these colors.  On a monochrome printer, colored objects will
     be mapped into different grayscales by the printer.   Filled
     objects  are  printed  using  the given area fill and color.
     There are 21 "shades" going from black to full saturation of
     the fill color, and 21 more "tints" from full saturation + 1
     to white.  In  addition,  there  are  16  patterns  such  as
     bricks, diagonal lines, crosshatch, etc.

     -c   option centers the figure on the page.   The  centering
          may  not be accurate if there are texts in the <I>fig</I>_<I>file</I>
          that extends too far to the right of other objects.

     -e   option puts the figure against the edge (not  centered)
          of the page.

     -l dummy_arg
          Generate figure in landscape mode.  The dummy  argument
          is  ignored,  but  must  appear on the command line for
          reasons of compatibility.  This  option  will  override
          the  orientation  specification  in  the file (for file
          versions 3.0 and higher).
          This option is only  honored  when  not  using  the  -P
          option  (add  showpage).   This  is  because the figure
          doesn't need to be rotated when generating Encapsulated
          PostScript (EPS).

     -M   Generate multiple pages if figure exceeds paper size.

     -p dummy_arg
          Generate figure in portrait mode.  The  dummy  argument
          is  ignored,  but  must  appear on the command line for
          reasons of compatibility.  This  option  will  override
          the  orientation  specification  in  the file (for file
          versions 3.0 and higher).  This is the default for  Fig
          files of version 2.1 or lower.

     -P   indicates that the figure describes a full  page  which
          will  not  necessarily be inserted into a document, but
          can be sent directly to a  PS  printer.   This  ensures
          that  a  showpage command is inserted at the end of the
          figure.

     -n name
          Set the Title part of the PostScript  output  to  <I>name</I>.
          This  is  useful  when  the input to <I>fig2dev</I> comes from
          standard input.

     -x offset
          shift the figure in the X  direction  by  <I>offset</I>  units
          (1/72 inch).  A negative value shifts the figure to the
          left and a positive value to the right.

     -y offset
          shift the figure in the Y  direction  by  <I>offset</I>  units
          (1/72 inch).  A negative value shifts the figure up and
          a positive value down.

     -z papersize
          Sets the papersize. Available paper sizes are:
              "Letter" (8.5" x 11" also "A"),
              "Legal" (11" x 14" also "A")
              "Ledger" (11" x 17"),
              "Tabloid" (17" x 11", really Ledger in Landscape mode),
              "A" (8.5" x 11" also "Letter"),
              "B" (11" x 17" also "Ledger"),
              "C" (17" x 22"),
              "D" (22" x 34"),
              "E" (34" x 44"),
              "A4" (21  cm x  29.7cm),
              "A3" (29.7cm x  42  cm),
              "A2" (42  cm x  59.4cm),
              "A1" (59.4cm x  84.1cm),
              "A0" (84.1cm x 118.9cm),
              and "B5" (18.2cm x 25.7cm).


</PRE>
<H2>PSTEX OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
     The pstex language is a variant of ps which suppresses  for-
     matted (special) text.  The pstex_t language has the comple-
     mentary behavior: it generates only LaTeX commands necessary
     to position special text, and to overlay the PostScript file
     generated using pstex. These two drivers can be used to gen-
     erate  a figure which combines the flexibility of PostScript
     graphics with LaTeX text formatting of special text.

     -n name
          sets the Title part of the PostScript output  to  <I>name</I>.
          This  is  useful  when  the input to <I>fig2dev</I> comes from
          standard input.

     -p file
          specifies the name of the PostScript file to  be  over-
          laid.   If not set or its value is null then no PS file
          will be inserted.


</PRE>
<H2>TK OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
     -l dummy_arg
          Generate figure in landscape mode.  The dummy  argument
          is  ignored,  but  must  appear on the command line for
          reasons of compatibility.  This  option  will  override
          the  orientation  specification  in  the file (for file
          versions 3.0 and higher).

     -p dummy_arg
          Generate figure in portrait mode.  The  dummy  argument
          is  ignored,  but  must  appear on the command line for
          reasons of compatibility.  This  option  will  override
          the  orientation  specification  in  the file (for file
          versions 3.0 and higher).  This is the default for  Fig
          files of version 2.1 or lower.

     -P   Generate canvas of full page size instead of using  the
          bounding box of the figure's objects. The default is to
          use only the bounding box.

     -z papersize
          Sets the papersize.  See  the  POSTSCRIPT  OPTIONS  for
          available  paper  sizes.  This is only used when the -P
          option (use full page) is used.


</PRE>
<H2>TEXTYL OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
     There are no TeXtyl-specific options.


</PRE>
<H2>METAFONT OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
     <I>fig2dev</I> scales the figure by 1/8 before generating  METAFONT
     code.   The magnification can be further changed with the -m
     option or by giving magnification options to mf.

     In order to process the generated METAFONT code,  the  mfpic
     macros  must  be installed where mf can find them. The mfpic
     macro package is available at any CTAN cite under  the  sub-
     directory: graphics/mfpic

     -C code
          specifies the starting METAFONT font code. The  default
          is 32.

     -n name
          specifies the name to use in the output file.

     -p pen_magnification
          specifies how much the line width should  be  magnified
          compared to the original figure. The default is 1.

     -t top
          specifies the top of the whole coordinate  system.  The
          default is ypos.

     -x xneg
          specifies the minimum x coordinate value of the  figure
          (inches). The default is 0.

     -y yneg
          specifies the minumum y coordinate value of the  figure
          (inches). The default is 0.

     -X xpos
          specifies the maximum x coordinate value of the  figure
          (inches). The default is 8.

     -Y ypos
          specifies the maximum y coordinate value of the  figure
          (inches). The default is 8.


</PRE>
<H2>JPEG OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
     -q image_quality
          use the integer value <I>image</I>_<I>quality</I> for the JPEG "Qual-
          ity" factor.  Valid values are 0-100.


</PRE>
<H2>GIF OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
     -t color
          Use <I>color</I> for the transparent color in  the  GIF  file.
          This  must  be  specified  as  a  six-digit hexadecimal
          RGBvalue with the # sign, e.g. #ff0000 (Red).

<H2>BUGS and RESTRICTIONS</H2><PRE>
     Please send bug reports, fixes, new features etc. to:
     xfig-bugs@epb1.lbl.gov (Brian V. Smith)

     Arc-boxes are not supported for the tk output language,  and
     only  X  bitmap pictures are supported because of the canvas
     limitation in tk.

     Picture objects are not scaled with the magnification factor
     for tk output.

     Because tk scales canvas items according to  the  X  display
     resolution,  polygons, lines, etc. may be scaled differently
     than imported pictures (bitmaps) which aren't scaled at all.

     Rotated text is only supported in  the  IBM-GL  (HP/GL)  and
     PostScript (including eps) languages.
